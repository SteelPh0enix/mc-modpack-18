# SteelPh0enix's Minecraft 1.18 modpack
My Minecraft 1.18(.1) modpack

This modpack is Fabric-based and includes mods that enhance
* **Performance** - multiple mods for increasing both server- and client-side performance
* **Ergonomics** - mutliple mods for quality-of-life utilities, like inventory sorting or item lookup
* **Gameplay** - some technical and gameplay mods that add many new items

I did not touched the default worldgen, as i wanted this modpack to utilize new vanilla 1.18 generator. Have fun!

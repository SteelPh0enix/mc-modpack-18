# SteelPh0enix's Minecraft 1.18 modpack
My Minecraft 1.18(.1) modpack

This modpack is Fabric-based and includes mods that enhance
* **Performance** - multiple mods for increasing both server- and client-side performance
* **Ergonomics** - mutliple mods for quality-of-life utilities, like inventory sorting or item lookup
* **Gameplay** - some technical and gameplay mods that add many new items
* **Visuals** - i've included a bit of visual-enhancing mods, notable ones being Iris for shader support and LambDynamicLights for dynamic lightning!

I did not touched the default worldgen, as i wanted this modpack to utilize new vanilla 1.18 generator. Have fun!


## Installation

1. Download [packwiz bootstrapper](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases/download/v0.0.3/packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar) and put it in your Minecraft instance directory (`.minecraft`)
2. Either add this as pre-launch command in your Minecraft launcher, or run this once after installing Minecraft 1.18.1 with Fabric: `java -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteelPh0enix/mc-modpack-18/master/pack.toml"`

The mods should be downloaded and ready to use.
